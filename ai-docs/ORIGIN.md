The Origin of Ki
Ki (氣/気) is an ancient East Asian concept meaning life force, vital energy, breath—the invisible current flowing through all living things.
In traditional practice, cultivating Ki means harmonizing mind, body, and spirit through presence, breath, and intentional practice. When your Ki flows freely, you are aligned with your true nature.
