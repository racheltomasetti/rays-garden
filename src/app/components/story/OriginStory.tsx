        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
          freshman year consisted of a series of blackouts. one of the{" "}
          <em>freakiest neurological occurences</em> also happens to be
          categorized as a fun night out. my experience of consciousness became
          a <strong>disjointed one</strong>, alternating intervals of awareness
          and emptiness, the gaps swelling from hours into days. i desperately
          wanted to find my place, to fit in, and to make the most of my time in
          college, often coined as the <em>best years of your life.</em>
        </p>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
          and i did find my place, and these have become some of my best years,
          with <em>the best yet to come</em>. but the way that i was going about
          it was all wrong. and at the pace i was going,{" "}
          <strong>something was bound to break</strong>.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
          <strong>and break i did.</strong> a string of two particular
          blackouts, the first a catalyst for the second, shook me to my core.
          in the first, i came out of the blackout with a man i did not
          recognize on top of me in a place i had never been before. seven hours
          of my memory --- <strong>poof ! gone !</strong> the next morning, as i
          tried to grapple with what had happened, i remember being filled with
          such{" "}
          <em>
            shame, guilt, blame, Self-<strong>hate</strong>... how did i let
            this happen? i am disgusting. i <strong>hate</strong> every cell in
            my being.
          </em>{" "}
          i remember thinking how excited i was for seven years to pass so that
          all of my body&apos;s cells could regenerate and i would be reborn a
          new person. that i could erase this memory from my body.

          following this blackout, i fell deeper into my destructive habits.
          despite what had happened, i continued to be{" "}
          <em>careless with my mind and my body</em>.{" "}
          <strong>pushing myself past my limits </strong>until on a Saturday
          like any other, i took it further than i had before. to the point
          where my friends had to rush my incoherent self to the hospital. where
          i threw up in the uber and my limp body had to be loaded onto a
          stretcher and into the ambulance. where they had to cut the jeans from
          my body and put me through an MRI to see if i&apos;d caused any
