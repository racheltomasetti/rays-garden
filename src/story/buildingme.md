## building me

I know—we jumped from the beginning to here, and you might be wondering: how did we get here?
The truth is: everything contributed. Everything.
Three years of daily showing up. Rewiring habits one morning at a time. Running until my body remembered what it felt like to be alive. Journaling through the fog until clarity emerged. Learning that my mind and body were never separate. Discovering my cycle wasn't something to manage but a tool for understanding myself. Building self-belief brick by brick when no one else could see what I was creating.
Struggling to start. Feeling stuck, lost, confused. Being misunderstood by the people closest to me. Questioning everything. Doubting myself.
And then—I started building. I stopped getting caught up in my head and started doing.
That's when everything fell into place.
Because building K·I and building me were never separate journeys. They are one and the same. Every line of code was an act of self-discovery. Every feature I built taught me something about how I work, what I need, who I am. The tool shaped me as much as I shaped it.
That's how we got here. That's how you get there too.
One day at a time. In the NOW.
