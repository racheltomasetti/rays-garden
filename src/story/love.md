it may have taken a long time,
but in the end it did not matter.
after much healing through
self-observation she now had
strength, she now had courage,
and the wisdom to wield her new
magic with virtue. no longer did
she run from her pain or her
troubles, no longer did she allow
delusions to capture her mind, no
longer did she doubt that the greatest
healer she has ever met is her own
unconditional love.

(you are a healer)
