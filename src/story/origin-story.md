### falling

_[march 2022] {mindset ~ i have life all figured out.}_

freshman year consisted of a series of blackouts. one of the freakiest neurological occurences also happens to be categorized as a fun night out. my experience of consciousness became a disjointed one, alternating intervals of awareness and emptiness, the gaps swelling from hours into days. i desparately wanted to find my place, to fit in, and to make the most of my time in college, often coined as the best years of your life.

and i did find my place, and these have become some of my best years, with the best yet to come. but the way that i was going about it was all wrong. and at the pace i was going, something was bound to break.

and break i did. a string of two particular blackouts, the first a catalyst for the second, shook me to my core. in the first, i came out of the blackout with a man i did not recognize on top of me in a place i had never been before. seven hours of my memory --- poof ! gone ! the next morning, as i tried to grapple with what had happened, i remember being filled with such shame, guilt, blame, Self-hate... how did i let this happen? i am disgusting. i hate every cell in my being. i remember thinking how excited i was for seven years to pass so that all of my body's cells could regenerate and i would be reborn a new person. that i could erase this memory from my body.

### falling still

following this blackout, i fell deeper into my destructive habits. despite what had happened, i continued to be careless with my mind and my body. pushing myself past my limits. until on a Saturday like any other, i took it further than i had before. to the point where my friends had to rush my incoherent self to the hospital. where i threw up in the uber and my limp body had to be loaded onto a stretcher and into the ambulance. where they had to cut the jeans from my body and put me through an MRI to see if i'd caused any permanent damage to my brain.

none of this i remembered, of course.

when i came to in the hospital bed, one of the first things i remember thinking was --- _where are my jeans?_
