      the origin of ki
    </h3>
    
    <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed text-[var(--tx-2)] italic">
      ki (氣/気) is an ancient East Asian concept meaning life force, 
      vital energy, breath. it is the invisible current that flows through 
      all living things—the essence of being alive and conscious.
    </p>
    
    <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed text-[var(--tx-2)] italic">
      <span className="font-bold text-[var(--accent)]">
        in traditional practice, cultivating ki means harmonizing mind, body, 
        and spirit.
      </span>{" "}
      it is developed through presence, breath, and intentional practice. 
      when your ki flows freely, you are aligned with your true nature.
    </p>
    
    <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed text-[var(--tx-2)] italic">
      this is exactly what the tool does: it helps you cultivate your 
      life force through daily practice, harmonizing your mind and body, 
      unlocking the unlimited power that has always existed within you.

      ki is a tool to explore your mind. a space where thoughts become 
      knowledge, and knowledge becomes wisdom.

      <span className="font-bold text-[var(--accent)]">
        it recognizes that mind and body are one.
      </span>{" "}
      your hormonal cycles, your energy levels, your emotional states—
      these aren't obstacles to productivity. they are intelligence. 
      ki meets you where your body is, adapting to support your natural rhythms.
    </p>
    
    <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed text-[var(--tx-2)] italic">
      through AI, ki becomes a mirror for your consciousness. it helps you:

    <div className="pl-8 space-y-4 text-lg text-[var(--tx-2)] italic">
      <p>→ capture thoughts as they arise (ideas, questions, emotions, learnings)</p>
      <p>→ expand thoughts into deeper understanding through AI-powered exploration</p>
      <p>→ cultivate wisdom by recognizing patterns across time</p>
      <p>→ share your journey, contributing to collective consciousness</p>

    <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed text-[var(--tx-2)] italic">
      our greatest tools can also be our downfall. technology can fragment 
      our attention, distort our self-perception, disconnect us from our bodies. 
      AI can hallucinate, manipulate, replace human agency.

    <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed text-[var(--tx-2)] italic">

        ki exists in the goldilocks zone: technology that makes us superhuman 
        without losing our humanity.

      it augments consciousness without replacing it. it accelerates growth 
      without bypassing the journey. it provides intelligence on tap while 
      honoring the wisdom that can only come from lived experience.
